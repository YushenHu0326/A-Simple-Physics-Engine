# A-Simple-Physics-Engine
## Introduction
This repository is a copy of a physics library I am currently working on under Future Reality Lab's webXR platform. I decide to keep a copy of the library and constantly update with the files I have in FRL's main repository, as it can be a good start or template for any 3D-based physics engine.
## Features (TO BE ADDED)
### Basic physical features: mass, inertia, acceleration, velocity, e.t.c.
Given Javascript is not an OOP language, the data structure will be array-based. However, it can be modified with any preferred structure you like in other languages.
### Colliders: sphere, box, capsule
### Collision response: velocity change, angular velocity change
### Cloth simulation
### SPH-based large scale particle simulations
Let's hope I can write one without burning down the CPU and GPU of our lab's Quest 3 headsets.
